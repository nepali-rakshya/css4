/* 
SOME WONDERS OF FLOATS

1. Float gives up its position and floats, it abandons its 
original space in the page, but when margin is used it shows the
involvement of the space.

2. Though position: relative doesn't abandon its original space
it doesn't affect any content or elements below or above it, but 
keeps a vacant space.

3. Float desipte of it floating, when used margin it takes the 
element or content below it.

4. position: absolute, literally abandons everything. Space, element
and content.
